In this chapter, we provide instructions on installing RStudio, Shiny, and Jupyter servers via Docker on Amazon EC2. Running these Docker containers in the cloud enables statisticians and data scientists to perform compute-intensive tasks and build scalable data products with their preferred programming languages (e.g., R, Python). 2.1 Docker Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu # Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release # Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key: curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | \\ sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg # Use the following command to set up the stable repository. echo &quot;deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) \\ signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] \\ https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable&quot; | \\ sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list &gt; /dev/null # Update the apt package index, and install the latest version of Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose. sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin # Add your user to the docker group. sudo usermod -aG docker $USER # Run the following command to activate the changes to groups: newgrp docker # Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo. docker run hello-world 2.2 RStudio Docker for RStudio Server docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e ROOT=TRUE -e PASSWORD=yourpasswordhere rocker/rstudio http://&lt;public-ip-address&gt;:8787 2.3 Shiny Docker for Shiny Server docker run -d -p 3838:3838 rocker/shiny http://&lt;public-ip-address&gt;:3838 2.4 Jupyter Docker for Jupyter Server docker run -d -p 8888:8888 jupyter/datascience-notebook http://&lt;public-ip-address&gt;:8888 "],["simple-storage-service.html", "Chapter 3 Simple Storage Service", " Chapter 3 Simple Storage Service Content to be added.
